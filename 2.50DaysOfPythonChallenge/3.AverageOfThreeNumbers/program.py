#Program to find Average of Three Number
firstNumber = float(input("Enter The first Number : "))

    #To Calculate Average Of Three Number

Avg = (firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber)/3

    #display the Average

print ('The Average of {0}, {1} and {2} is {3}'.format(firstNumber,secondNumber, thirdNumber,Avg))

    #print('The Average Of three numbers is :',Avg)


#output
# Enter The first Number : 10    
# Enter The second Number : 20
# Enter The third Number : 60

# The Average of 10.0, 20.0 and 60.0 is 30.0
